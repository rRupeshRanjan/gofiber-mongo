This project demonstrates usage of fiber and mongo with golang.

In this project, we aim to build a RESTful API, allowing CRUD operations for books in a library.

 - Fiber is a Go web framework built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. It's designed to ease things up for fast development with zero memory allocation and performance in mind.
 - MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents.  
 - viper is a configuration solution for Go applications.
 - zap provides blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go.
